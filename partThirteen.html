            There is a frank recount of how Aaron Sherrit was chased down and killed in a dangerous cat and mouse game
            that had lasted for several weeks. Cornered in Avenel, he had nowhere to run and was killed in a struggle
            barely lasting for a minute, recounted Ned Kelly.
            Ned then correctly assumed that the police would then make haste to capture them while they knew about their
            whereabouts.
            <br><br>
            They escaped to a hotel in Glenrowan owned by Mrs Jonesâ€™. They then rested and camped out for several days
            until they thought the coast was clear. They then kidnapped a schoolteacher called Curnow as a hostage as
            they retreated into the bush.
            <br><br>
            This is the last thing that Ned Kelly wrote that he sent to his daughter. On page 7, the letter abruptly
            ended.
