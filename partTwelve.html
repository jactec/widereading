            In this chapter, there are descriptions of how the policemen were partnering with and helped by native
            Indigenous
            trackers to help them track and manipulate the Kelly Gang into an ambush. There is
            also evidence that at the time, the construction of Ned Kellyâ€™s armour was being made,
            taking great inspiration from the hut that Harry Power had shown all those years ago. Ned seeked to make
            himself bulletproof. After using it in several different confrontations the armour is proved to be extremely
            useful and modern
            rather than mediaeval as Ned says.
