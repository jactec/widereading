      Soon after his father’s death the Kelly family moved to Greta. Ned Kelly would
      start breaking horses and breed sheep to trade and shear for extra profit. Soon, their Uncle James
      Kelly would arrive at the large family farm. Despite not being very good at many tasks he proved to be “a very
      lively fellow to have about the premises”. However it is soon
      revealed that Uncle James was trying to get on Ellen’s good side as he was attracted to her. Ellen and Ned
      eventually
      slapped him out of the house.
      <br><br>
      The next day they woke up to find their house on fire. Once they got out of the house they found Uncle James drunk
      and it is soon revealed that he set the house
      on fire. During a court hearing for sentencing Uncle James for his crimes, he said nothing in his defence, only
      saying that
      he will marry Ellen Kelly. He was hanged shortly after.
      <br><br>
      A couple of days later, the Kelly children woke to see their mother upon a handsome mare and calling that she had
      secured a new spot of land. The Kelly family would then start clearing the
      land
      and fencing the perimeter. Once this was done they could bring in their cows which produced butter for them to
      sell.
      With better living conditions and a good location for selling their products, the Kelly family flourished. Ned
      Kelly was
      doing the man's work in the family so that his siblings and mother could
      ride to school on horses instead of walking.
      <br><br>
      A couple of days later, at night they heard a person wandering around in the dark. It turns out that the person is
      Harry Power the famous bushranger. It was during that
      time that three men: Harry Power, Bill Frost and Alex Gunn, would repeatedly come
      over to the Kelly family’s hut and either bring gifts or help with chores.
      It seemed like the three men were competing to see who could marry Annie Kelly. It was soon determined that Alex
      Gunn was to marry Annie Kelly, much to her delight.
